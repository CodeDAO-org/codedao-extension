TARGET_BRANCH="main"

# Features:
# ✅ AI agent commit detection with signature matching
# ✅ Comprehensive metrics calculation (lines, functions, files)
# ✅ Estimated CODE token reward calculation
# ✅ Secure GitHub token handling
# ✅ Detailed success/failure reporting
# ✅ Professional terminal UI with colors and emojis
```

#### **2. AI Agent Integration**
